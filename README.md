## 💡 What is it??

We created a to-do application, where it is possible to create a new task, delete it and mark it as completed.
The project's intuition was to show in practice more about the state in React

## 🧪 Tests

- Run `yarn test` to run

- App Page should be able to add a task
- App Page should not be able to add a task with a empty title
- App Page should be able to remove a task
- App Page should be able to check a task

## 💻 Setup

- Clone the repository
- Run `yarn install` to install dependencies
- Run `yarn dev` to run the project

## ⚙️ Built With
